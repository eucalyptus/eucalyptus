   - Pure in-memory database
   - Image registration over WS interface
   - Improved build procedure

    - For the administrator (addition, approval, disabling,
      and deletion of users; disabling of images)
- Numerous bug fixes, improving stability and performance.
   In particular, but not limited to:
   - Recovering Cloud Controller system state
