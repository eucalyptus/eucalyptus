/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.simpleworkflow.AmazonSimpleWorkflow#terminateWorkflowExecution(TerminateWorkflowExecutionRequest) TerminateWorkflowExecution operation}.
 * <p>
 * Records a <code>WorkflowExecutionTerminated</code> event and forces
 * closure of the workflow execution identified by the given domain,
 * runId, and workflowId. The child policy, registered with the workflow
 * type or specified when starting this execution, is applied to any open
 * child workflow executions of this workflow execution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If the identified workflow execution was in
 * progress, it is terminated immediately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If a runId is not specified, then the
 * WorkflowExecutionTerminated event is recorded in the history of the
 * current open workflow with the matching workflowId in the domain.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> You should consider using RequestCancelWorkflowExecution
 * action instead because it allows the workflow to gracefully close
 * while TerminateWorkflowExecution does not.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Access Control</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
 * resources as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use a <code>Resource</code> element with the domain name to limit
 * the action to only specified domains.</li>
 * <li>Use an <code>Action</code> element to allow or deny permission to
 * call this action.</li>
 * <li>You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's
 * parameters.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
 * action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
 * constraints, the action fails by throwing
 * <code>OperationNotPermitted</code> . For details and example IAM
 * policies, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html"> Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows </a>
 * .
