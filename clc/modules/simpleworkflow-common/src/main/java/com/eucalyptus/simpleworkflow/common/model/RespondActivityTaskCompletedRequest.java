/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.simpleworkflow.AmazonSimpleWorkflow#respondActivityTaskCompleted(RespondActivityTaskCompletedRequest) RespondActivityTaskCompleted operation}.
 * <p>
 * Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified
 * by the <code>taskToken</code> completed successfully with a
 * <code>result</code> (if provided). The <code>result</code> appears in
 * the <code>ActivityTaskCompleted</code> event in the workflow history.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If the requested task does not complete
 * successfully, use RespondActivityTaskFailed instead. If the worker
 * finds that the task is canceled through the canceled flag returned by
 * RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat, it should cancel the task, clean up and
 * then call RespondActivityTaskCanceled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it
 * is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is
 * processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call
 * to RespondActivityTaskCompleted, RespondActivityTaskCanceled,
 * RespondActivityTaskFailed, or the task has
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types"> timed out </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Access Control</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
 * resources as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use a <code>Resource</code> element with the domain name to limit
 * the action to only specified domains.</li>
 * <li>Use an <code>Action</code> element to allow or deny permission to
 * call this action.</li>
 * <li>You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's
 * parameters.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
 * action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
 * constraints, the action fails by throwing
 * <code>OperationNotPermitted</code> . For details and example IAM
 * policies, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html"> Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows </a>
 * .
