/**
 * <p>An abstract implementation of the {@link Future} interface.  This class
 * is an abstraction of {@link FutureTask} to support use
 * for tasks other than {@link Runnable}s.  It uses an
 * {@link AbstractQueuedSynchronizer} to deal with concurrency issues and
 * guarantee thread safety.  It could be used as a base class to
 * {@code FutureTask}, or any other implementor of the {@code Future} interface.
 *
 * <p>This class implements all methods in {@code Future}.  Subclasses should
 * provide a way to set the result of the computation through the protected
 * methods {@link #set(Object)}, {@link #setException(Throwable)}, or
 * {@link #cancel()}.  If subclasses want to implement cancellation they can
 * override the {@link #cancel(boolean)} method with a real implementation, the
 * default implementation doesn't support cancellation.
 *
 * <p>The state changing methods all return a boolean indicating success or
 * failure in changing the future's state.  Valid states are running,
 * completed, failed, or cancelled.  Because this class does not implement
 * cancellation it is left to the subclass to distinguish between created
 * and running tasks.
