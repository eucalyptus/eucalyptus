# Udev rules for device-mapper devices.
#
# These rules set permissions for DM devices.
#
# This file is considered to be a template where users can put their
# own entries and then put a copy of it manually to a usual place with
# user-edited udev rules (usually /etc/udev/rules.d).
#
# There are some environment variables set that can be used:
#   DM_UDEV_RULES_VSN - DM udev rules version
#   DM_NAME - actual DM device's name
#   DM_UUID - UUID set for DM device (blank if not specified)
#   DM_SUSPENDED - suspended state of DM device (0 or 1)
#   DM_LV_NAME - logical volume name (not set if LVM device not present)
#   DM_VG_NAME - volume group name (not set if LVM device not present)
#   DM_LV_LAYER - logical volume layer (not set if LVM device not present)

# PLAIN DM DEVICES
#
# Set permissions for a DM device named 'my_device' exactly
# ENV{DM_NAME}=="my_device", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for all DM devices having 'MY_UUID-' UUID prefix
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="MY_UUID-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"


# LVM DEVICES
#
# Set permissions for all LVM devices
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="LVM-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for all devices that belong to one LVM VG
# ENV{DM_VG_NAME}=="VolGroup00", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for an LVM device with VG named VolGroup00 and LV named LogVol00 exactly
# ENV{DM_VG_NAME}=="VolGroup00", ENV{DM_LV_NAME}=="LogVol00", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for all LVM devices that does not belong to a VG named VolGroup00
# ENV{DM_VG_NAME}!="VolGroup00", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"


# ENCRYPTED DEVICES (using cryptsetup >= 1.1)
#
# Set permissions for all encrypted devices created by cryptsetup (plain devices)
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="CRYPT-PLAIN-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for all encrypted devices created by cryptsetup (LUKS extension)
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="CRYPT-LUKS1-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for an encrypted device created by cryptsetup and having an exact luks UUID
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="CRYPT-LUKS1-22fce5c8313c43c68d84b50a3b0fee78-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"


# MULTIPATH DEVICES
#
# Set permissions for all multipath devices
ENV{DM_UUID}=="mpath-?*", OWNER:="eucalyptus", GROUP:="disk", MODE:="660"

# Set permissions for first two partitions created on a multipath device (and detected by kpartx)
# ENV{DM_UUID}=="part[1-2]-mpath-?*", OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"


# ...you can use any combination of the comparisons with the environment variables
# listed at the beginning of this file (udev provides simple pattern matching by
# using *, ? and [] that you can use, see 'man udev' for more information).

# Set default permissions for all DM devices if not set before.
# OWNER:="root", GROUP:="root", MODE:="660"
