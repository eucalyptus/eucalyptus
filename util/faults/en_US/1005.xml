        1) Ensure that the CLOUD_OPTS variable set in eucalyptus.conf includes a value for 
           --XX:MaxPermSize. Set or increase this value as necessary: by default, it should be at 
           least 64MB. This value can be expressed in bytes, or as '64M', '1G' etc.
        2) Restart the cloud application.
        3) If this condition continues despite a high value for --XX:MaxPermSize, it may be 
           necessary to add more physical memory to the machine.
