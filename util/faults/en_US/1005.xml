        1) Ensure that the CLOUD_OPTS variable set in eucalyptus.conf includes a value for 
           -XX:MaxPermSize=<xx>M. Set or increase this value as necessary: Eucalyptus overrides 
           the standard java default of 64MB to 256MB, you'll likely need to set it to 384MB or higher.
	   This value can be expressed in bytes, or as '384M', '1G' etc.
        2) Restart the cloud application.
        3) If this condition continues despite a high value for --XX:MaxPermSize, it may be 
           necessary to add more physical memory to the machine.
