        1) Ensure that the CLOUD_OPTS variable set in eucalyptus.conf includes 
           a value for -Xmx. Set or increase this value as necessary: by 
           default, it should be at least 1GB or 1/4 of the physical memory, 
           whichever is smaller. This value can be expressed in bytes, or as '1G'.
        2) Restart the cloud application.
        3) If this condition continues despite a high value for -Xmx, it may be 
           necessary to add more physical memory to the machine.
